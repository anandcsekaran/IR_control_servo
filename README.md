# IR_control_servo

This repository contains the code to control servo motor using IR remote.

There are 3 .ino files in this repo:
1. IR_Moves_Sensor
2. Remote_Values
3. Servo_control

You can use Remote_Values.ino to find the DEC, HEX values when each button is pressed. In my case, i have uploaded the Information.docx.

Servo_control.ino can be used to test your servo motor seperately first too.

Finally IR_Moves_Sensor.ino can be used to control the servo using your IR remote.
